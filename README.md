this webpage is a basic landing page with an example of the id manual that will be build in the future. I am still waiting on USPTO to get back to me on the address and key to the id manual I want to use. But this will do for now. it is a landing page for my dad's lawfirm, that gives basic information regarding trademarks. the form is super basic and calls to an api I pushed to heroku.  # MarkMyLogo
